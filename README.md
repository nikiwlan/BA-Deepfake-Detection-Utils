# BA-Deepfake-Detection-Utils

This repository contains supplementary scripts and documentation for the evaluation of three state-of-the-art deepfake detection models as part of my bachelor's thesis.

## Content of the repository

This repository provides a detailed overview of how the models were evaluated using different datasets. It includes step-by-step instructions on:

- Downloading the models and datasets
- Preparing the data
- Using the models
- Adapting the scripts
- Evaluating the performance

All necessary scripts and documentation are included to replicate the evaluation metrics and ROC curves, or to test on new datasets contained in the repository.
